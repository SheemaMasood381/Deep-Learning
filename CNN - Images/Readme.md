# Cat-Dog CNN Classifier

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of cats and dogs. The model achieves an impressive **97% accuracy**, with an **AUC score of 1**, and a **F1-score of 97%**, demonstrating its robustness in distinguishing between the two categories.

## Key Features
- **High Accuracy**: 97% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - AUC (Area Under Curve): **1**
  - F1 Score: **97%**
  - Confusion Matrix included for performance analysis.
- **Model Architecture**: Built using CNN layers for efficient image feature extraction and classification.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes a dataset of cat and dog images.

## Project Structure
- **`cat-dog-cnn-classifier-97-Accuracy.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation, including:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model architecture and training
  - Evaluation metrics
- **Images and Visualizations**: Includes plots and confusion matrix visualization for better understanding.
